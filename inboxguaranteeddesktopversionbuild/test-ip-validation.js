  // Troubleshooting
  log('TROUBLESHOOTING', 'blue');
  log('─'.repeat(80), 'gray');
  log(`Problem: "Still getting Access Denied even though IP is added"
Solution:
  1. Check that IP is properly formatted in database (no spaces/typos)
  2. Verify user.authorizedIps is not empty in logs
  3. Compare exact IP strings - may need to normalize
  4. Restart server after adding IPs
  5. Check admin panel - verify IP was actually saved

Problem: "Dev mocking not working"
Solution:
  1. Verify NODE_ENV=development is set (not production)
  2. Verify TEST_PUBLIC_IP=102.89.41.126 (or your test IP)
  3. Check logs for [DEV] IP Mocking message
  4. Restart server after changing env vars
  5. Verify request is coming from localhost socket

Problem: "All requests failing in production"
Solution:
  1. Confirm NODE_ENV=production (dev mocking disabled)
  2. Verify proxy is sending X-Forwarded-For header
  3. Check what IP logs show vs. what's in authorized list
  4. Add the client IP from logs to authorized IPs
  5. Verify trust proxy setting matches your deployment

Problem: "Can't see any IP validation logs"
Solution:
  1. Make sure request is going to protected endpoint (requires requireAuthorizedIp)
  2. Verify user is authenticated (has valid JWT token)
  3. Check that request has Authorization header
  4. Ensure NODE_ENV is not 'test' which might suppress logs
  5. Try curl with verbose flag: curl -v ...
